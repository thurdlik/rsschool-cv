## **About me:**

  I'm 29 years old. Most of my life I worked as a teacher or a tutor. 
  But I decided to change that. My aim is to learn programming and to 
  start working as a programmer. I want to create my own app for phones someday. 
  I am not really a fast learner, but once I comprehend something, nothing
  can undo it. Also I have quite good management skills.

    else:
        total += price
    price = floaat(input())
print(total)
```
